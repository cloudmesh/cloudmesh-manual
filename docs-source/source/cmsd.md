# Cloudmesh cmsd

Cloudmesh cmsd is a command to run cloudmesh in a container regardles of
the OS. Thus it is extreemly easy to install and use.

cmsd will however use locally installed keys in `~/.ssh` and cloud
configurations stred in `~/.cloudmesh/cloudmehs.yaml`. The yaml file
will be created upon first call of cmsd if it is not available.

## End user deployment 

Please uese a python virtualenv as to not interfere with your system python.
Activate your python venv. Next just call

    pip install cloudmesh-cmsd
    
This will install a command `cmsd' in your environment that you can use
as in place replacement for the cms command.

## Developer Source install

For developers it can be installed in an easy fashion with

    mkdir cm
    cd cm
    pip install cloudmesh-installer -U
    cloudmesh-installer git clone cmsd
    cloudmesh-installer git install cmsd
 
Now you can use the command 

    cmsd help

The source code is contained in 

    cloudmesh-cmsd


## Mongo Configuration in ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml

You will need to set the configuration MODE from native to running

Native setup (typicall you will have)

      MONGO_AUTOINSTALL: true
      MONGO_BREWINSTALL: false
      MONGO_URL: mongodb://mongodb:27017
      MODE: native
      LOCAL: ~/local
      MONGO_DBNAME: cloudmesh
      MONGO_HOST: 127.0.0.1
      MONGO_PORT: '27017'

docker setup (you need to change this to)

      MONGO_AUTOINSTALL: true
      MONGO_BREWINSTALL: false
      # MONGO_URL: 'mongodb://mongo:27017'
      MODE: running
      LOCAL: ~/local
      MONGO_DBNAME: cloudmesh
      MONGO_HOST: 'mongo'
      MONGO_PORT: '27017'
